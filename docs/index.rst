.. _welcome:

Welcome to SDFusionViaPoints!
===========================================================

This project provides an user interface for Autodesk Fusion 360, that Äºets users easily add and modify muscle via-points. The SDFusion exporter (links see below) is able to parse these via-points into SDFormat. This is used to simulate our tendon-driven robots.

The user interface itself is a python addin, which needs to be loaded into Autdesk Fusion 360 and executed.
