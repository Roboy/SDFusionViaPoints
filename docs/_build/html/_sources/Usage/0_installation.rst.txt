Installation
=============

Git clone the following repository: https://github.com/Roboy/SDFusion

**Do NOT rename the folder/ the .py file or the .manifest file!**

To make the script known to Fusion, run the Script and Add-Ins command and click the green "+" icon beside the "My Scripts" folder in the dialog, as shown below. Use the dialog to browse to the location of the script .py file. The script will now be listed in the Scripts and Add-Ins dialog and you can run, edit, and debug it from there the same as any other script or add-in. You only need to do this once and Fusion will remember the script or add-in for all subsequent sessions.

If the script does not show up in the Fusion script menu, restart Fusion.
