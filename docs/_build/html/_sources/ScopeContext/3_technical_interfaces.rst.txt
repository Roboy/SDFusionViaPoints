This section describes the data interfaces to other systems around it. It follows 3 of the `levels of interoperability <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_interoperability>`_ (**IO**):

.. todo::
  For all your interfaces, define their first 3 `levels of interoperability <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_interoperability>`_.
  You can use your doxygen documented source code to i.e. show all members of a class.
